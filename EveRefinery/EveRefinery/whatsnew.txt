2.2 [17oct20]
* Database upgrade to 2020-10-12
* REMINDER: I haven't played EVE for years now, literally.
  If you want a DB update - let me know by email!

2.2 [19feb18]
* New toolbar button: "Always on top".
  Supposed use: When you select loot for hauling, you open EveRefinery
  and EVE side by side. Then you sort EveRefinery list the same way as
  in game, read EveRefinery hints and move items aside in EVE. This new
  button helps you see both windows at once when they don't fit on screen.
  This feature's code was prepared by Bless (Valery Kornilovich).

2.2 [19feb18]
* EveRefinery can now pull prices from market.fuzzwork.co.uk
  because eve-central.com is dead.
  All praise Bless (Valery Kornilovich), who provided code and forced me to integrate it (sigh)!
* EveRefinery can now pull prices from eve-marketdata.com
* Database upgrade to 2018-02-14
* REMINDER: I haven't played EVE for years now, literally.

  -------------------------------------
* NOTE: In patch notes, there is a line:
  "Reprocessing tax has been changed from a material tax to an ISK tax"
  I'm not playing EVE and can't test myself. Does that mean I need to remove
  tax multiplier from EveRefinery settings? Please test and let me know.

2.1 [23apr16]
* Database upgrade to 2016-03-09
  -------------------------------------

  I consider EveRefinery to be superseded with EVE UI improvements.
  If you still use EveRefinery, let me know, how!
  My e-mail is alexandr.miloslavskiy@gmail.com
  Also, it's up to you to remind me to update database... If you still want it.

+ Location combobox in main window now shows Outpost names
  correctly instead of naming them "Unknown location".
* Cache files (such as assets, market prices, outposts)
  were moved to "Cache" subdirectory to clean up main directory.
* I decided to change version numbering scheme to more common.
  I started with 2.1 this time, since EveRefinery is definitely
  more mature then 1.0 now. This doesn't mean great features, sorry.
